Source and Object Code Software License Agreement


IMPORTANT – PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING LICENSE AGREEMENT CAREFULLY.  THIS IS A LEGALLY BINDING AGREEMENT.  AFTER YOU READ THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT, YOU WILL BE ASKED WHETHER YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT.  DO NOT CLICK “I HAVE READ AND AGREE” UNLESS: (1) YOU ARE AUTHORIZED TO ACCEPT AND AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF YOURSELF OR YOUR COMPANY; AND (2) YOU INTEND TO ENTER INTO AND TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LEGALLY BINDING AGREEMENT ON BEHALF OF YOURSELF OR YOUR COMPANY.


Important – Read carefully: This source and object code software license agreement (“Agreement”) is a legal agreement between you (either an individual or entity) and Texas Instruments Incorporated (“TI”).  The “Licensed Materials” subject to this Agreement include the software programs (in whole or in part) that accompany this Agreement and which you access “on-line” and/or electronic documentation (in whole or in part) associated and provided with these software programs, as well as any updates or upgrades to such software programs and documentation, if any, provided to you at TI’s sole discretion.  The Licensed Materials are specifically designed and licensed for use solely and exclusively in connection with TI DLP Chipsets manufactured by or for TI.  The Bluetopia® stack software is specifically designed and licensed for use solely and exclusively with a CC256x device manufactured by or for TI (“TI CC256x Device”) in combination with a TI-branded or non-TI-branded microprocessor.  For purposes of this Agreement, a TI “DLP Chipset” is composed of a TI DLP digital micromirror device (“DLP DMD”) and one or more TI DLP DMD control semiconductor devices (“DLP Controllers”).  By installing, copying or otherwise using the Licensed Materials you agree to abide by the provisions set forth herein.  This Agreement is displayed for you to read prior to using the Licensed Materials.  If you choose not to accept or agree with these provisions, do not download or install the Licensed Materials.  

Note Regarding Possible Access to Open Source Software:  The Licensed Materials may be bundled with Open Source Software.  "Open Source Software" means any software licensed under terms requiring (A) that other software (“Proprietary Software”) incorporated, combined or distributed with such software or developed using such software: (i) be disclosed or distributed in source code form; or (ii) otherwise be licensed on terms inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, including but not limited to permitting use of the Proprietary Software on or with devices other than DLP Chipsets or TI CC256x Devices (in the case of the Bluetopia® stack software), or (B) the owner of Proprietary Software to license any of its patents to users of the Open Source Software and/or Proprietary Software incorporated, combined or distributed with such Open Source Software or developed using such Open Source Software. 

By accepting this Agreement, you may gain access to Open Source Software, in which case such Open Source Software will be listed in the applicable software manifest (in whole or in part, the “Open Source Materials”).  Your use of the Open Source Materials is subject to the separate licensing terms applicable to such Open Source Materials as specified in the applicable software manifest.  For clarification, this Agreement does not limit your rights under, or grant you rights that supersede, the license terms of any applicable Open Source Materials license agreement.  If any of the Open Source Materials have been provided to you in object code only, TI will provide to you or show you where can access the source code versions of such Open Source Materials if you contact TI at Texas Instruments Incorporated, 6550 Chase Oaks Boulevard, Mail Station 8478, Plano, Texas 75023, Attention: Contracts Manager.  You may terminate this Agreement in the event you choose not to accept or agree with the terms in any applicable Open Source Materials license agreement, provided that such termination occurs within five (5) calendar days of acceptance of this Agreement and you abide by all applicable license terms in this Agreement until such termination.
